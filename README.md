# ShoppingCart

Take home assignment to build out a Shopping Cart component.

Built using Javascript. Utilizes Mocha/Chai for testing purposes.

Tests check that the Shopping Cart component accurately adds items to the cart and price total. The two tests combined show that all 3 methods(add, totalAmount, and itemsList) all function properly.

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` to install necessary dependencies

### `npm test` to run through tests
